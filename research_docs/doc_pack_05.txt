Fiber-based (paper) packaging is increasingly used to replace plastic, but performance for moisture/grease can require barrier layers.

Water-based barrier coatings can improve performance; however, excessive coating weight or certain additives may reduce repulpability and recycling outcomes.

A practical approach is to match barrier performance to the minimum needed, validate recyclability with downstream partners, and avoid mixed-material laminates when possible.
