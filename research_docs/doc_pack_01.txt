a) Right-sizing reduces total material use and often lowers shipping emissions by reducing dimensional (DIM) weight.

b) In e-commerce, box size variability is a major driver of void fill (paper, air pillows) and damage rates. Teams that redesign the packout process typically see both cost and waste reduction.

c) Common implementation pattern: start with a small set of box sizes, measure damage/returns, then incrementally add sizes or on-demand box making for long-tail SKUs.
