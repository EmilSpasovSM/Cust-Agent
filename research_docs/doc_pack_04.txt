Clear disposal instructions can improve consumer sorting behavior, especially when packaging uses newer materials (e.g., paper with barrier coatings).

A simple recommendation is to align labels with the actual local end-of-life pathway: recycle where accepted, compost only where industrial composting exists, otherwise dispose.

Overly generic sustainability messaging can increase contamination when consumers "wishcycle" items into recycling.
