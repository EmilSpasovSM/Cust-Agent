Compostable mailers can reduce fossil-based plastics, but their real-world benefit depends on access to industrial composting and correct disposal behavior.

Many programs prefer recyclable mono-material mailers (e.g., all-PE) because they align with existing recycling streams, though contamination and collection rates remain constraints.

A frequent best practice is to avoid mixed-material laminates when possible; if barrier performance is required, consider coatings that preserve recyclability and provide clear disposal instructions.
